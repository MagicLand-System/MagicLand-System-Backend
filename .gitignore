True or False. JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is a widely used authentication scheme in ASP.NET Core Web API. It uses a session approach where the client sends a valid JWT session in the request's Authorization header. This session is verified by the server using a secret key or through a public-private key pair. JWT authentication is stateless and allows for easy scalability and interoperability.
